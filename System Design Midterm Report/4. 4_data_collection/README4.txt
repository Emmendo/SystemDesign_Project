A file was added in this folder called 'Script for Data Collection.txt', this is already included in the source code python and exe files automatically. 
This connection is needed for data transfer into the code and transferring back into the database and tables from the SMS app.



Tables were set up in the SSMS to populate the data behind the code shown in the source code python/exe files. 
In all tests, the code will repopulate anything done in the SMS app back into the database such as teacher assignment grading done in the app - the particular table will be updated with the feedback and grade for that assignment.
